FuguMobile
==========

Misc scripts for Unity iOS. Mostly works with Unity Android, too.

C# scripts are in the Fugu namespace and thus require Unity 4+ (if you're running Unity 3.x, try removing the namespace declaration).

See the FuguEditor repo for Editor scripts, FuguUnity for cross-platform scripts (for mobile, you'll be interested in the batching script), and LearnUnity for Javascript scripts.
